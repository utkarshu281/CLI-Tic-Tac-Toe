# Tic Tac Toe (CLI – Java)

A command-line Tic Tac Toe game built in Java as a practice project while learning core programming concepts. The game supports two-player turn-based gameplay, board state management using a 2D array, and win detection across rows, columns, and diagonals.

## Features

* Two-player CLI gameplay
* Dynamic board rendering
* Input-based coordinate selection
* Win condition checks (rows, columns, diagonals)
* Clear separation of responsibilities (`UI`, `Board`, `Main`)

## Tech Stack

* Java
* Core Java libraries (`Scanner`, arrays)

## Project Structure

* `Main` – entry point of the application
* `UI` – handles user interaction and input
* `Board` – manages game state and win logic

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the Java files
3. Run the `Main` class from the terminal

## Learning Outcomes

* Working with 2D arrays
* Loop control and conditional logic
* Algorithmic thinking for win conditions
* Writing maintainable, structured code

## Future Improvements

* Draw condition handling
* Input validation for out-of-range coordinates
* Single-player mode with basic AI
* Variable board size (NxN)
